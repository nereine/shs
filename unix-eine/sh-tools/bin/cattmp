# cattmp - stupid cpu temperature monitor utility
case "$1" in *h*) less << _EOF_ 
On Linux systems, cattmp by default is used to monitor lmsensors,
though it can also run watch command on temperature files in /sys/class/thermal

On macOS systems, cattmp uses 'osx-cpu-temp' to print current CPU temperature every 1 second
Homebrew can be used to install osx-cpu-temp: brew install osx-cpu-temp
